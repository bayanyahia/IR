# Information Retrieval Assignment 💻🔍

This repository contains the implementation and results of the Information Retrieval assignment completed. 📚

## Assignment Overview 📝

The assignment tasks were focused on various aspects of Information Retrieval, including language modeling, text classification, and text clustering. Here's a brief overview of each task:

### Language Modeling 🗣️🔤
- Tokenized text from the assigned directory.
- Created language models for the collection.
- Performed linguistic operations like removing stop words, case folding, and stemming.
- Compared and discussed the differences between language models at each step.

### Text Classification 📄🔍
- Utilized the "Train and Test" and "Negative examples" directories.
- Labeled documents according to categories.
- Performed linguistic operations including tokenization and stop words removal.
- Used machine learning libraries such as WEKA or SCIKIT to perform classification with four chosen classifiers.
- Reported and discussed the classification results, examining misclassified documents.

### Text Clustering 📂🔍
- Collected documents from additional directories as instructed.
- Employed machine learning libraries for clustering, utilizing K-means with four clusters.
- Analyzed clustering results and explained any errors.

## Data and Tools 🛠️📊

- Data was assigned individually and shared in a joint directory.
- I utilized Python for implementation and various libraries such as NLTK for text processing and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
